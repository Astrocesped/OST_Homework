These folders contain the projects that correspond to each lesson in the now
deceased School of Technology from O'Reilly. I offer them as samples of code
for others to learn and as a display of my journey as a Python developer.

You'll notice some evolution in certain practices while going from the first
to the fourth course; in Python 1, the modules are spread in a single
directory, with lines that go over the Python Practice of only including 79
characters. That is improved in Python 2 onwards.

Aside from directories per each project from Python 2, there are Unittest
module for each project. And from the last projects in Python 3 onwards,
a 'project_log.py' and a log file are included in most directories, as
part of a debugging practice. You can identify the main module as the
one that contains the 'she-bang' line inside each directory.

Feel free to copy and improve my code and mistakes.
